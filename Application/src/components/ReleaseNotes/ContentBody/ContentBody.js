              Release notes are documents that people receive when they buy
              and/or download software products. Nowadays, they're often
              distributed virtually. In the modern world, release notes are more
              important than ever. This is because buying software products
              isn't as straightforward a process as it used to be. Buying
              software products is now an ongoing process as you can count on
              the fact that you'll be sent product updates, bug fixes, new
              features, and more after your initial purchase.
